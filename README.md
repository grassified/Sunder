## What is Sunder?

Sunder is a lightweight, native desktop music player that streams from YouTube without the bloat. Built with Tauri v2 and Rust, it uses a fraction of the memory that Electron-based alternatives consume while delivering a buttery smooth UI with hand-crafted animations.

The name says it all: to *sunder* means to split apart. We split the music from the surveillance.

## Features

### Playback
- **YouTube search** with instant results and FTS5-powered local caching
- **Dual-Source Search**: Automatically merges results from YouTube Music (for official releases) and regular YouTube (for remixes and covers) into a single, cohesive view
- **Native audio** via rodio, talking directly to ALSA/PipeWire/Pulse with no Web Audio overhead
- **Seamless Seeking**: Mutes the audio stream during seek operations to eliminate pops and glitches, providing a smooth navigation experience
- **Smart error recovery** if a track fails (geo-blocked, age-gated, unavailable), a banner appears offering to find an alternative version automatically, with auto-skip fallback if ignored
- **Retry with bypass** yt-dlp failures trigger a silent retry with `--force-ipv4` and `--geo-bypass` before giving up
- **Non-Blocking Preparation**: Session-based audio preparation, allowing you to skip tracks rapidly without blocking the audio thread or getting stuck in a "Preparing" state
- **Prefetching**: Silently pre-downloads upcoming tracks for seamless transitions
- **Media Key Support**: Fully integrated with system media controls (MPRIS on Linux). Control playback using your keyboard's hardware multimedia keys (Play/Pause, Next, Previous)

### Queue
- **Three-section view**: Now Playing card, Next Up (with drag-to-reorder), Previously Played
- **Fluid animations** track cards slide and flip into position when the song changes, when you drag-reorder, or when tracks enter/leave the queue
- **Context menu integration** right-click any track to play next, add/remove from queue, add to or remove from a playlist
- **Auto-advance**: queue advances automatically on track end; stops gracefully after 3 consecutive errors

### Playlists
- **Full CRUD** with inline rename, quick-play, and drag-to-reorder
- **YouTube Music Import**: Effortlessly import entire YT Music playlists via URL. Sunder automatically detects the playlist name and fetches all tracks for your local collection
- **Remove from context menu** right-click any track to remove it from the current playlist

### App
- **Explore** with personalized recommendations built from your listening history
- **Synced & Dynamic Lyrics**: Fetches synced lyrics from multiple high-quality sources (LRCLIB, Lyrics.ovh, etc.). If no synced lyrics are available, it automatically falls back to YouTube transcripts for maximum reliability
- **User Configuration**: Highly customizable settings via a persistent configuration system. Adjust seek steps, volume increments, subtitle languages, and more to fit your workflow
- **Visual Notifications**: Native system notifications on track changes, featuring the song title, artist name, and a high-quality cropped thumbnail for an polished, integrated experience
- **Warm animated UI** with spring physics, staggered entrances, glow pulses, and micro-interactions
- **~15MB binary** with release optimizations (LTO, strip, single codegen unit)
- **Zero telemetry**. Nothing leaves your machine except YouTube search queries

## Install

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
# Source build
yay -S sunder

# Prebuilt binary
yay -S sunder-bin
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Download the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases):

```bash
sudo dpkg -i sunder_*_amd64.deb
```

### Other Linux

Download the `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases):

```bash
chmod +x Sunder_*.AppImage
./Sunder_*.AppImage
```

### Windows

Download the `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases).

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder/releases).

### Runtime Dependencies

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) must be installed and on PATH:

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# Windows (scoop)
scoop install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Shell | **Tauri v2** | Native webview, no bundled browser. ~100x lighter than Electron |
| Frontend | **Svelte 5** | Runes-based reactivity, zero virtual DOM overhead |
| Audio | **rodio 0.19** | Pure Rust audio with symphonia decoders (MP3/AAC/FLAC/Vorbis/WAV) |
| Extraction | **yt-dlp** | Reliable stream URL resolution, community-maintained |
| Database | **SQLite + FTS5** | WAL-mode for concurrent reads, full-text search on cached tracks |
| Build | **Vite 6** | Sub-second HMR, optimized production builds |


### Why this beats Electron music apps

1. **Memory**: Sunder idles at ~40MB. Electron apps start at 200MB+.
2. **Startup**: Native webview launches in milliseconds. No Chromium cold-start.
3. **Audio**: rodio talks directly to your OS audio stack. No Web Audio API jank.
4. **Privacy**: yt-dlp runs locally. No Google account, no tracking cookies.
5. **Size**: The release binary is ~15MB. Electron apps ship 150MB+ of Chromium.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, 2021 edition)
- **Node.js** >= 18
- **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** installed and on PATH

Linux dev dependencies:

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg pango atk

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrogSnot/Sunder.git
cd Sunder
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The optimized binary lands in `src-tauri/target/release/sunder`.

## UI Design

Warm, golden-tinted dark palette designed for long listening sessions:

- **Base**: Deep warm blacks (`#0f0e0d`, `#181614`)
- **Accent**: Burnished gold (`#e0a820`) with ambient glow effects
- **Animations**: 11+ custom keyframe animations including spring physics, staggered cascades, equalizer loaders, and floating idle states

Every interaction has tactile feedback. Buttons snap with spring easing, tracks lift on hover, active items pulse with a warm glow. The queue uses Svelte's `flip` and `fly` transitions so card positions animate smoothly during reorder and song changes -- tracks cascade up one by one when a new song starts, and slide out cleanly when removed.

## Data

The database is stored locally in platform-specific locations:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.sunder.app/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\com.sunder.app\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.sunder.app/`

Audio is cached temporarily in `/tmp/sunder/` and automatically reused on replay.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Local track downloads with library management
- [X] Lyrics display
- [X] Keyboard shortcuts / media key support
- [ ] System tray with mini player
- [X] Audio equalizer
